## Installation

To use the VaultBridge Protocol, simply clone this repository to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VaultBridge.git
cd VaultBridge
```

Ensure you have a compatible blockchain environment (e.g., Stacks) set up to interact with the protocol.

## Usage

VaultBridge uses a set of predefined smart contracts, enabling trade management via public functions. Admins and users can interact with the system using the available public functions. 

### Example Use Cases:

- **Complete a Trade**: Admin or client can complete a trade after certain validations.
- **Raise Dispute**: A client or vendor can raise a dispute on a trade, and an admin can resolve it by dividing the funds.
- **Create Staged Trade**: A client can create a staged trade with multiple payments.

## Error Handling

VaultBridge uses custom error codes for various invalid actions. Some common errors include:
- `ERR_AUTH`: Unauthorized access.
- `ERR_NOT_FOUND`: Trade not found.
- `ERR_FAILED_TX`: Transaction failure.
- `ERR_TIMEOUT`: Deadline exceeded.
